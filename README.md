## Introduction

80% of city residents are tenants. What this necesarrily means is that majority of the housing
in the city is owned by just a few groups and individuals. It isnâ€™t uncommon to find one
landlord owning several hundred apartment/property units.

## Problem Statement

Seeing as landlords often manage multiple property units, there is significant data that needs
to be collected for efficient management. In the best of scenarios, Landlords typically use
spreadsheets which are cumbersome to access across multiple devices and complicated to
manipulate, and in the worst of scenarios, some landlords use the old fashioned pencil and
notebook, which is archaic to say the least. There is a wealth of data that can be useful for a
landlord if the proper data management is done.

## The Product
To help curb this defficiency in management systems that are suitable for landlords' and landladys' seeking to find a management system tailored for them we designed HAO to help them.
`Hao` is a simple web app that solves this problem by allowing landlords'  and landladys' to store and
manipulate their property data and gather data intelligence to make strategic decisions.

## Minimum Viable Product

The first version of the application must meet the following metrics:<br>

1. A simple dashboard
2. Landlords can create(add) property records
3. Landlords can read(access) property records
4. Landlords can updateproperty records
5. Landlords can delete(remove) property records
