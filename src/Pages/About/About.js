                    Due to the fact that landlords frequently manage multiple
                    properties, there is a lot of data that needs to be
                    collected. For landlords to manage properties efficiently,
                    this is essential. It is imperative that the right data and
                    statistics are populated in order to make efficient data
                    management decisions when it comes to the management of
                    data. The Hao platform has been developed to connect
                    individuals who need efficient statistics. This platform has
                    been developed to be easy to use for individuals while
                    having a simple user interface to make the user's life
                    easier.
